An N x N grid (aka matrix) is given. Every cell in the grid has an integer value from 1 to N (inclusive). Return true if the grid is a Latin square, and return false otherwise. A Latin square is an N × N array filled with N different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row, and exactly once in each column. An example of a 3 × 3 Latin square is
